/*
Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately.
You need to decide whether itâ€™s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments.
You can remember by treating Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array.

Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have this set to the first parameter passed to bind().
